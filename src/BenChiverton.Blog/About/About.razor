    <h2>üë± Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Ben, a software engineer with experience in the FinTech space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within technology, my main interests are understanding how systems scale with businesses, and how technology teams scale with systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I mess around with new tech, usually using the .NET platform.
        Check out my <a class="link" href="/projects">projects</a> to see what I've been messing around with recently.

    <h2>üåê What is this website?</h2>
    <p>
        This website is here to showcase the projects/blogs I've been working on. It's an index I use to quickly find resources that I often refer to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blogs and projects are usually software based, discussing or demonstrating concepts I find interesting.
        The resources are anything from software documentation to coding exercises to articles I enjoyed reading. Tags are the best way to search for similar resources.
