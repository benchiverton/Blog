    <h2>üë± Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Ben, and I'm a software engineer.
        I have experience building financial systems within the funds and investments space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within technology, my main interests are understanding how systems scale with businesses, and how technology teams scale with systems.
        My preferred approach to system design follows the principles of domain-driven design - I believe thorough business understanding and bounded contexts are key to building correct, efficient and scalable systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I mess around with new tech, usually using the .NET platform.
        Check out my <a class="link" href="/projects">projects</a> to see what I've been messing around with recently.

    <h2>üåê What is this website?</h2>
    <p>
        This website is here to showcase the projects/blogs I've been working on. It's an index I use to quickly find resources that I often refer to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blogs and projects are usually software based, discussing engineering concepts or demonstrating something I've hacked together.
        The resources are anything from software documentation to coding exercises to articles I enjoyed reading - the tags are the best way to search for similar resources.

            <p>
                I am currently based in Camden, London, where I've been living for the past @(DateTime.Now.Year - 2017) years.
                I still enjoy explorint the city - after all, as someone famous once said...

            <h2>üìú History</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Fleet, Hampshire, and attended Farnborough Sixth Form where I studied maths, further maths and physics.
                I went to Warwick University and studied maths and statistics, which I dropped after second year to pursue an opportunity I was offered in software engineering.
