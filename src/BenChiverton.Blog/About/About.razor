    <h2>üë± Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Ben, and I'm a software engineer.
        Previously I've designed and developed financial systems within the funds and investments space, and now I lead several engineering teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        My main interests right are understanding how businesses scale effectively, how systems scale with businesses, and how software engineering teams scale with systems.
        I'm a big believer in domain driven design - I think thorough business understanding and bounded contexts are the keys to achieving scalability, and the contents of this site will reflect that.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I mess around with new tech - particularly in .NET/python.
        Check out my <a class="link" href="/projects">projects</a> to see what I've been messing around with recently.
    </p>
    <h2>üåê What is this site?</h2>
    <p>
        This site is here to showcase the projects/blogs I've been working on. It's an index I use to quickly find resources that I often refer to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blogs and projects are primarily software based, discussing engineering concepts I find interesting or demonstrating something I've hacked together whilst messing around with some new tech.
        The resources are anything from software documentation to coding exercises to articles I enjoyed reading - the tags are the best way to search for similar resources.

            <h2>üè† Home</h2>
            <p>
                I rent a flat in Camden, London, which is more of a base than a home - it's located near where I work and near major transport links so I can easily get away for the weekend.
                I've been living in London for the past 5 years, and I continue to enjoy my time here.
                After all, as someone famous once said...

            <h2>üìú History</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Fleet, Hampshire, and attended Farnborough Sixth Form where I studied maths, further maths and statistics.
                I went to Warwick University and studied maths and statistics, which I dropped after second year to persue a position I was offered in software engineering.
